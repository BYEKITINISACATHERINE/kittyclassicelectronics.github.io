            <p style="color:black;">Pre-Installation Assessment: Before the installation process begins, technicians conduct a thorough assessment of the customer's requirements, environment, and existing infrastructure. This helps ensure that the installation is tailored to meet the specific needs of the customer and that any potential challenges are identified in advance.
